Java Swing Restaurant Ordering App
Hi, this is a small project I finished in 3 days for my AP CSA class.
Its a simple java gui program that tracks your restaurant order. 
It gives you the price at the end.
One thing about this project is that the orderlist class is completely useless. I only made it to satisfy project requirements.
